We introduce and study the class of weak almost limited operators. We
establish a characterization of pairs of Banach lattices [m1], [m2] for which
every positive weak almost limited operator [m3] is almost
limited (resp. almost Dunford-Pettis). As consequences, we will give some
interesting results.

1. Introduction

Throughout this paper [S1.p1.m1] [S1.p1.m2] will denote real Banach spaces, and [S1.p1.m3]
will denote real Banach lattices. [S1.p1.m4] is the closed unit ball of [S1.p1.m5] and [S1.p1.m6] denotes the solid hull of a
subset [S1.p1.m7] of a Banach lattice. We will use the term operator [S1.p1.m8] between two Banach spaces to mean a bounded linear mapping.


Let us recall that a norm bounded subset [S1.p2.m1] of [S1.p2.m2] is called a Dunford-Pettis set (resp.a limited set) if each weakly null sequence
in [S1.p2.m3] (resp. weak* null sequence in [S1.p2.m4]) converges
uniformly to zero on [S1.p2.m5]. An operator [S1.p2.m6] is called Dunford-Pettis if [S1.p2.m7] in [S1.p2.m8] implies [S1.p2.m9], equivalently, if [S1.p2.m10] carries
relatively weakly compact subsets of [S1.p2.m11] onto relatively compact subsets of [S1.p2.m12]. An operator [S1.p2.m13] is said to be limited whenever [S1.p2.m14] is a limited set in [S1.p2.m15], equivalently, whenever [S1.p2.m16] for every
weak* null sequence [S1.p2.m17].


Aliprantis and Burkinshaw [1] introduced the class of weak
Dunford–Pettis operators. An operator [S1.p3.m1] is said to be
weak Dunford–Pettis whenever [S1.p3.m2] in [S1.p3.m3]
and [S1.p3.m4] in [S1.p3.m5] imply [S1.p3.m6], equivalently, whenever [S1.p3.m7] carries weakly
compact subsets of [S1.p3.m8] to Dunford–Pettis subsets of [S1.p3.m9] [2, Theorem 5.99]. Next H’michane et al. [8] introduced the class of weak*
Dunford-Pettis operators, and characterized this class of operators and
studied some of its properties in [9]. An operator [S1.p3.m10]
is called weak* Dunford-Pettis whenever [S1.p3.m11] in [S1.p3.m12] and [S1.p3.m13] in [S1.p3.m14]
imply [S1.p3.m15], equivalently, whenever [S1.p3.m16]
carries relatively weakly compact subsets of [S1.p3.m17] onto limited subsets of [S1.p3.m18]
[9, Theorem 3.2].


Recently, two classes of norm bounded sets are considered in the theory of
Banach lattices. From [3] (resp. [5]), a norm bounded
subset [S1.p4.m1] of a Banach lattice [S1.p4.m2] is said to be an almost
Dunford-Pettis set (resp. an almost limited set), if every disjoint
weak null (resp. weak* null) sequence [S1.p4.m3] in [S1.p4.m4] converges
uniformly to zero on [S1.p4.m5]. Clearly, all Dunford-Pettis sets (resp. limited
sets) in a Banach lattice are almost Dunford-Pettis (resp. almost limited).
Also, every almost limited set is almost Dunford-Pettis. But the converse
does not hold in general.


Let us recall that an operator [S1.p5.m1] is said to be almost
Dunford-Pettis, if [S1.p5.m2] carries every disjoint weakly null sequence to a
norm null sequence, or equivalently, if [S1.p5.m3] carries every disjoint weakly
null sequence consisting of positive terms to a norm null sequence [12, Remark 1]. From [10], an operator [S1.p5.m4] is called
almost limited whenever [S1.p5.m5] is an almost limited
set in [S1.p5.m6], equivalently, whenever [S1.p5.m7] for every disjoint weak* null sequence [S1.p5.m8].


Using the almost Dunford-Pettis sets, Bouras and Moussa [4]
introduced the class of weak almost Dunford-Pettis operators. An operator [S1.p6.m1] is called weak almost Dunford-Pettis operator
whenever [S1.p6.m2] carries relatively weakly compact subsets of [S1.p6.m3] to almost
Dunford–Pettis subsets of [S1.p6.m4], equivalently, whenever [S1.p6.m5] for all weakly null sequences [S1.p6.m6] in [S1.p6.m7] and for all
weakly null sequences [S1.p6.m8] in [S1.p6.m9] consisting of pairwise
disjoint terms [4, Theorem 2.1].


In this paper, using the almost limited sets, we introduce the class of
weak almost limited operators [S1.p7.m1], which carries
relatively weakly compact subsets of [S1.p7.m2] to almost limited subsets of [S1.p7.m3]
(Definition 2.1). It is a class which contains that of weak*
Dunford-Pettis (resp. almost limited). We establish some characterizations
of weak almost limited operators. After that, we derive the domination
property of this class of operators (Corollary 2.6). Next, we
characterize pairs of Banach lattices [S1.p7.m4], [S1.p7.m5] for which every positive weak
almost limited operator [S1.p7.m6] is almost limited (resp. almost
Dunford-Pettis). As consequences, we will give some interesting results.


To show our results we need to recall some definitions that will be used in
this paper. A Banach lattice [S1.p8.m1] has



-

the Dunford-Pettis property, if [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m1] in [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m2] and [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m3] in [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m4]
imply [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m5] as [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m6],
equivalently, each relatively weakly compact subset of [S1.I1.ix1.p1.m7] is
Dunford–Pettis.

-

the Dunford-Pettis* property (DP* property for short), if [S1.I1.ix2.p1.m1] in [S1.I1.ix2.p1.m2] and [S1.I1.ix2.p1.m3] in [S1.I1.ix2.p1.m4] imply [S1.I1.ix2.p1.m5], equivalently, each relatively weakly compact subset of [S1.I1.ix2.p1.m6] is limited.

-

the weak Dunford-Pettis* property (wDP* property), if [S1.I1.ix3.p1.m1] for every weakly null sequence [S1.I1.ix3.p1.m2] in [S1.I1.ix3.p1.m3] and for every disjoint weak* null sequence [S1.I1.ix3.p1.m4] in [S1.I1.ix3.p1.m5], equivalently, each relatively weakly
compact subset of [S1.I1.ix3.p1.m6] is almost limited [5, Definition 3.1].

-

the Schur (resp. positive Schur) property, if [S1.I1.ix4.p1.m1] for every weak null sequence [S1.I1.ix4.p1.m2] (resp. [S1.I1.ix4.p1.m3]).

-

the positive dual Schur property, if [S1.I1.ix5.p1.m1] for every weak* null sequence [S1.I1.ix5.p1.m2], equivalently, [S1.I1.ix5.p1.m3] for every weak* null sequence [S1.I1.ix5.p1.m4] consisting of
pairwise disjoint terms [13, Proposition 2.3].

-

the property (d) whenever [S1.I1.ix6.p1.m1] and [S1.I1.ix6.p1.m2] in [S1.I1.ix6.p1.m3] imply [S1.I1.ix6.p1.m4].




It should be noted, by Proposition 1.4 of [13], that every [S1.p10.m1]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice has the property [S1.p10.m2] but the
converse is not true in general. In fact, the Banach lattice [S1.p10.m3] has the property [S1.p10.m4] but it is not [S1.p10.m5]-Dedekind
complete [13, Remark 1.5].


Our notions are standard. For the theory of Banach lattices and operators,
we refer the reader to the monographs [2, 11].



2. Main results

We start this section by the following definition.


Definition 2.1.

An operator [S2.Thmtheorem1.p1.m1] from a Banach space [S2.Thmtheorem1.p1.m2] into a
Banach lattice [S2.Thmtheorem1.p1.m3] is called weak almost limited if [S2.Thmtheorem1.p1.m4] carries each
relatively weakly compact set in [S2.Thmtheorem1.p1.m5] to an almost limited set in [S2.Thmtheorem1.p1.m6].




Clearly, a Banach lattice [S2.p2.m1] has the DP* property (resp. wDP* property) if
and only if the identity operator [S2.p2.m2] is weak* Dunford-Pettis
(resp. weak almost limited). Also, every weak* Dunford-Pettis (resp. almost
limited) operator [S2.p2.m3] is weak almost limited, but the
converse is not true in general. In fact, the identity operator [S2.p2.m4] (resp. [S2.p2.m5]) is weak almost limited but it fail to be weak*
Dunford-Pettis (resp. almost limited).


In terms of weakly compact and almost limited operators the weak almost
limited operators are characterized as follows.


Theorem 2.2.

For an operator [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m1], the following assertions
are equivalents:



(1)

[S2.I1.i1.p1.m1] is weak almost limited.

(2)

If [S2.I1.i2.p1.m1] is a weakly compact operator, where [S2.I1.i2.p1.m2] is an
arbitrary Banach space, then the operator [S2.I1.i2.p1.m3] is almost limited.

(3)

If [S2.I1.i3.p1.m1] is a weakly compact operator then the
operator [S2.I1.i3.p1.m2] is almost limited.

(4)

For every weakly null sequence [S2.I1.i4.p1.m1] and
every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I1.i4.p1.m2]
we have [S2.I1.i4.p1.m3].





Proof.

[S2.p4.m1] Let [S2.p4.m2] be a disjoint weak* null sequence. We shall proof that [S2.p4.m3]. Otherwise, by choosing a subsequence we may suppose that
there is [S2.p4.m4] with [S2.p4.m5] for all [S2.p4.m6].
So for every [S2.p4.m7] there exists some [S2.p4.m8] with [S2.p4.m9].


On the other hand, as [S2.p5.m1] is weakly compact, [S2.p5.m2] is a relatively weakly compact subset of [S2.p5.m3] .
Then [S2.p5.m4]
is an almost limited set in [S2.p5.m5] (as [S2.p5.m6] is weak almost limited). So [S2.p5.m7] as [S2.p5.m8]. But this implies that [S2.p5.m9], which is impossible. Thus, [S2.p5.m10], and hence [S2.p5.m11] is almost limited.


[S2.p6.m1] Obvious.


[S2.p7.m1] Let [S2.p7.m2] be a weakly null sequence and let [S2.p7.m3] be a disjoint weak* null sequence. By Theorem 5.26 [2],
the operator [S2.p7.m4] defined by [S2.p7.m5], is weakly
compact. Thus, by our hypothesis [S2.p7.m6] is almost limited and hence [S2.p7.m7]. But



[S2.Ex1.m1]
[S2.Ex1.m2]
[S2.Ex1.m3]




[S2.Ex2.m2]
[S2.Ex2.m3]


for every [S2.p7.m8], where [S2.p7.m9] is the canonical basis of [S2.p7.m10]. Then [S2.p7.m11], as
desired.


[S2.p8.m1] Let [S2.p8.m2] be a relatively
weakly compact subset of [S2.p8.m3]. If [S2.p8.m4] is not almost limited
set in [S2.p8.m5] then there exists a disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p8.m6] such that [S2.p8.m7]. By choosing a subsequence we may suppose that there is [S2.p8.m8] with [S2.p8.m9] for all [S2.p8.m10]. So for every [S2.p8.m11] there exists some [S2.p8.m12] with [S2.p8.m13].


On the other hand, since [S2.p9.m1] is a relatively weakly compact subset of [S2.p9.m2],
there exists a subsequence [S2.p9.m3] of [S2.p9.m4] such that [S2.p9.m5] holds in [S2.p9.m6].
By hypothesis, [S2.p9.m7] and clearly [S2.p9.m8]. Now from [S2.p9.m9] we see that [S2.p9.m10], which is impossible. Thus, [S2.p9.m11] is an
almost limited set in [S2.p9.m12], and so [S2.p9.m13] is weak almost limited.
∎



Remark 2.3.

Every operator [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m1] that admits a factorization
through the Banach lattice [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m2], is weak almost limited.


In fact, let [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m1] and [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m2] be two operators such that [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m3]. Let [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m4] be a weakly null sequence and let [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m5] be a disjoint weak* null sequence. Clearly [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m6] holds in [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m7] and [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m8] holds in [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m9]. Since [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m10] has the Dunford-Pettis*
property then [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m11]. Thus [S2.Thmtheorem3.p2.m12] is weak almost
limited.



The next result characterizes, under some conditions, the order bounded weak
almost limited operators between two Banach lattices.


Theorem 2.4.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m1] and [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m2] be two Banach lattices such that the
lattice operations of [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m3] are sequentially weak* continuous or [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m4]
satisfy the property [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m5]. Then for an order bounded operator [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m6], the following assertions are equivalents:



(1)

[S2.I2.i1.p1.m1] is weak almost limited.

(2)

For every weakly null sequence [S2.I2.i2.p1.m1] and
every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I2.i2.p1.m2]
we have [S2.I2.i2.p1.m3].

(3)

For every disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.I2.i3.p1.m1]
and every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I2.i3.p1.m2] we have [S2.I2.i3.p1.m3].

(4)

For every disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.I2.i4.p1.m1] and every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I2.i4.p1.m2] we have [S2.I2.i4.p1.m3].

(5)

[S2.I2.i5.p1.m1] carries the solid hull of each relatively weakly compact subset of
[S2.I2.i5.p1.m2] to an almost limited subset of [S2.I2.i5.p1.m3].




If [S2.Thmtheorem4.p3.m1] has the property [S2.Thmtheorem4.p3.m2], we may add:



[S2.I3.ix1.m1]

[S2.I3.ix1.p1.m1] for every weakly null sequence [S2.I3.ix1.p1.m2] and every disjoint weak[S2.I3.ix1.p1.m3] null sequence [S2.I3.ix1.p1.m4].

[S2.I3.ix2.m1]

[S2.I3.ix2.p1.m1] for every disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.I3.ix2.p1.m2] and every disjoint weak[S2.I3.ix2.p1.m3] null sequence [S2.I3.ix2.p1.m4].





Proof.

[S2.p11.m1] and [S2.p11.m2] Follows from Theorem 2.2.


[S2.p12.m1] and [S2.p12.m2] are obvious.


[S2.p13.m1] Let [S2.p13.m2] be a relatively
weakly compact subset of [S2.p13.m3] and let [S2.p13.m4]
be a disjoint weak* null sequence. Put [S2.p13.m5] and
note that if [S2.p13.m6] is a disjoint
sequence then by Theorem 4.34 of [2] [S2.p13.m7]. Thus, by our hypothesis [S2.p13.m8] for
every disjoint sequence [S2.p13.m9] and every
disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p13.m10]. Now,
by Theorem 2.7 of [10] [S2.p13.m11] is almost limited.



[S2.p14.m1] Obvious.


[S2.p15.m1] and [S2.p15.m2] are obvious.


[S2.p16.m1] and [S2.p16.m2] Let [S2.p16.m3] be a
weakly null (resp. disjoint weakly null) sequence and let [S2.p16.m4] be a disjoint weak* null sequence.


If [S2.p17.m1] has the property [S2.p17.m2] then [S2.p17.m3]. So from the inequalities [S2.p17.m4] and [S2.p17.m5], the sequences [S2.p17.m6], [S2.p17.m7]
are weak* null. Finally, by [S2.p17.m8] (resp. [S2.p17.m9]), [S2.p17.m10].
∎



As consequence of Theorem 2.4 we obtain the following
characterization of the wDP* property which is a generalization of Theorem
3.2 of [5].


Corollary 2.5.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem5.p1.m1] be a Banach lattice with the property [S2.Thmtheorem5.p1.m2]. Then the
following assertions are equivalents:



(1)

[S2.I4.i1.p1.m1] has the wDP* property.

(2)

For every weakly null sequence [S2.I4.i2.p1.m1] and
every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I4.i2.p1.m2]
we have [S2.I4.i2.p1.m3].

(3)

For every disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.I4.i3.p1.m1]
and every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I4.i3.p1.m2] we have [S2.I4.i3.p1.m3].

(4)

For every disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.I4.i4.p1.m1] and every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.I4.i4.p1.m2] we have [S2.I4.i4.p1.m3].

(5)

The solid hull of every relatively weakly compact set in [S2.I4.i5.p1.m1] is almost
limited.

(6)

[S2.I4.i6.p1.m1] for every weakly null
sequence [S2.I4.i6.p1.m2] and every disjoint weak* null
sequence [S2.I4.i6.p1.m3].


(7)

[S2.I4.i7.p1.m1] for every disjoint weakly
null sequence [S2.I4.i7.p1.m2] and every disjoint weak*
null sequence [S2.I4.i7.p1.m3].





Recently, the authors in [6] demonstrated that if a positive weak*
Dunford-Pettis operator [S2.p19.m1] has its range in [S2.p19.m2]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice, then every positive operator [S2.p19.m3] that it dominates (i.e., [S2.p19.m4]) is also weak*
Dunford-Pettis [6, Theorem 3.1]. For the positive weak almost
limited operators, the situation still hold when [S2.p19.m5] satisfy the property
(d).


Corollary 2.6.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m1] and [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m2] be two Banach lattices such that [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m3]
satisfy the property [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m4]. Let [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m5] be two
positive operators such that [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m6]. Then [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m7] is a weak almost
limited operator whenever [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m8] is one.



Proof.

Follows immediately from Theorem 2.4 by noting that [S2.p20.m1] for
every disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.p20.m2] and
every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p20.m3].
∎



Note that, clearly, every almost limited operator [S2.p21.m1], from a
Banach space into a Banach lattice, is weak almost limited. But the converse
is not true in general. Indeed, the identity operator [S2.p21.m2] is Dunford-Pettis (and hence weak almost limited)
but it is not almost limited.


The next result characterizes pairs of Banach lattices [S2.p22.m1], [S2.p22.m2] for which
every positive weak almost limited operator [S2.p22.m3] is almost
limited.


Theorem 2.7.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m1] and [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m2] be two Banach lattices such that [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m3]
has the property [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m4]. Then, the following statements are
equivalents:



(1)

Every order bounded weak almost limited operator [S2.I5.i1.p1.m1] is
almost limited.

(2)

Every positive weak almost limited operator [S2.I5.i2.p1.m1] is
almost limited.

(3)

One of the following assertions is valid:



(i)

[S2.I5.i3.I1.ix1.p1.m1] has the positive dual Schur property.

(ii)

The norm of [S2.I5.i3.I1.ix2.p1.m1] is order continuous.







Proof.

[S2.p23.m1] Obvious.


[S2.p24.m1] Assume by way of
contradiction that [S2.p24.m2] does not have the positive dual Schur property and
the norm of [S2.p24.m3] is not order continuous. We have to construct a
positive weak almost limited operator [S2.p24.m4] which is not almost
limited. To this end, since the norm of [S2.p24.m5] is not order continuous,
there exists a disjoint sequence [S2.p24.m6] satisfying [S2.p24.m7] and [S2.p24.m8]
for all [S2.p24.m9] and for some [S2.p24.m10](see Theorem
4.14 of [2]).


On the other hand, since [S2.p25.m1] does not have the positive dual Schur property,
then there is a disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p25.m2]
such that [S2.p25.m3] is not norm null. By choosing a subsequence we may
suppose that there is [S2.p25.m4] with [S2.p25.m5] for all [S2.p25.m6]. From the equality [S2.p25.m7], there exists a sequence [S2.p25.m8] such that [S2.p25.m9]
holds for all [S2.p25.m10].


Now, consider the operators [S2.p26.m1] and [S2.p26.m2] defined by



[S2.Ex3.m1]


and



[S2.Ex4.m1]


for each [S2.p26.m3] and each [S2.p26.m4]. Since



[S2.Ex5.m1]


for each [S2.p26.m5] and each [S2.p26.m6], the operator [S2.p26.m7] is well
defined, and clearly [S2.p26.m8] and [S2.p26.m9] are positives. Now, consider the positive
operator [S2.p26.m10], and note that [S2.p26.m11] for each [S2.p26.m12]. Clealry,
as [S2.p26.m13] has the Schur property, then [S2.p26.m14] is Dunford-Pettis and hence [S2.p26.m15] is weak almost limited. However, for the disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p26.m16], we have for every [S2.p26.m17],



[S2.Ex6.m1]




Thus



[S2.Ex7.m1]


for every [S2.p27.m1]. This show that [S2.p27.m2] is not almost limited, and we are done.


[S2.p28.m1] In this case, every operator [S2.p28.m2] is almost limited. In fact, let [S2.p28.m3] be a disjoint weak* null sequence. Since [S2.p28.m4] has the
property [S2.p28.m5] then the positive disjoint sequence [S2.p28.m6] is weak* null. So by the
positive dual Schur property of [S2.p28.m7], [S2.p28.m8], and hence [S2.p28.m9], as desired.


[S2.p29.m1] According to Proposition 4.4 of [10] it is sufficient to show [S2.p29.m2] for every norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p29.m3] and every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p29.m4]. As the norm of [S2.p29.m5] is order
continuous then every norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p29.m6] is weakly null [11, Theorem 2.4.14]. Now, since [S2.p29.m7] is
an order bounded weak almost limited operator then by Theorem 2.4 [S2.p29.m8] for
every norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p29.m9] and
every disjoint weak* null sequence [S2.p29.m10]. This complete the proof.
∎



As consequence of Theorem 2.7, we obtain the following
corollary.


Corollary 2.8.

For a Banach lattices [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m1] with the property [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m2], [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m3] has
an order continuous norm if and only if every positive weak almost limited
operator [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m4] is almost limited.



Proof.

Follows from Theorem 2.7 by noting that if [S2.p31.m1] has the
positive dual Schur property then the norm of [S2.p31.m2] is order
continuous.
∎



As the Banach space [S2.p32.m1] has the Schur property then every operator [S2.p32.m2] is weak almost limited. Another consequence of
Theorem 2.7 is the following characterization of the
positive dual Schur property.


Corollary 2.9.

A Banach lattices [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m1] with the property [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m2], has the positive
dual Schur property if and only if every positive operator [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m3] is almost limited.



Recall that a reflexive Banach space with the Dunford-Pettis property is
finite dimensional [2, Theorem 5.83]. We can prove a similar result
for Banach lattices as follows.


Proposition 2.10.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem10.p1.m1] be a Banach lattice with the wDP* property. If the norms of [S2.Thmtheorem10.p1.m2] and [S2.Thmtheorem10.p1.m3] are order continuous then [S2.Thmtheorem10.p1.m4] is finite dimensional.


In particular, a reflexive Banach lattice with the wDP* property is finite
dimensional.



Proof.

Assume that the norms of [S2.p34.m1] and [S2.p34.m2] are order continuous. As [S2.p34.m3]
has the wDP* property the identity operator [S2.p34.m4] is weak
almost limited. Since the norm of [S2.p34.m5] is order continuous then, by
Theorem 2.7, [S2.p34.m6] is almost limited. So [S2.p34.m7] has the positive
dual Schur property. Now, as the norm of [S2.p34.m8] is order continuous then [S2.p34.m9] is
finite dimensional [13, Proposition 2.1 (b)]. For the second part,
it is enough to note that if [S2.p34.m10] is a reflexive Banach lattice then the
norms of [S2.p34.m11] and [S2.p34.m12] are order continuous [2, Theorem 4.70].
∎



Note that from Theorem 2.4, it is easy to see that if [S2.p35.m1] is
a Banach lattice with property [S2.p35.m2] then every order bounded
almost Dunford-Pettis operator [S2.p35.m3] is weak almost limited.
But the convers is false in general. In fact, the identity operator [S2.p35.m4] is weak almost limited operator but
it fail to be almost Dunford-Pettis.


The following result characterizes pairs of Banach lattices [S2.p36.m1], [S2.p36.m2] for
which every positive weak almost limited operator operator [S2.p36.m3]
is almost Dunford-Pettis.


Theorem 2.11.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem11.p1.m1] and [S2.Thmtheorem11.p1.m2] be two Banach lattices such that [S2.Thmtheorem11.p1.m3] is [S2.Thmtheorem11.p1.m4]-Dedekind complete. Then, the following statements are equivalents:



(1)

Every order bounded weak almost limited operator [S2.I6.i1.p1.m1] is
almost Dunford-Pettis.

(2)

Every positive weak almost limited operator [S2.I6.i2.p1.m1] is
almost Dunford-Pettis.

(3)

One of the following assertions is valid:



(i)

[S2.I6.i3.I1.ix1.p1.m1] has the positive Schur property.

(ii)

The norm of [S2.I6.i3.I1.ix2.p1.m1] is order continuous.







Proof.

[S2.p37.m1] Obvious.


[S2.p38.m1] Assume by way of
contradiction that [S2.p38.m2] does not have the positive Schur property and the
norm of [S2.p38.m3] is not order continuous. We have to construct a positive weak
almost limited operator [S2.p38.m4] which is not almost
Dunford-Pettis. As [S2.p38.m5] does not have the positive Schur property, then there
exists a disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.p38.m6] in [S2.p38.m7] which is not
norm null. By choosing a subsequence we may suppose that there is [S2.p38.m8] with [S2.p38.m9] for all [S2.p38.m10]. From the equality [S2.p38.m11], there exists a sequence
[S2.p38.m12] such that [S2.p38.m13] and [S2.p38.m14] holds for all [S2.p38.m15].


Now, consider the operator [S2.p39.m1] defined by



[S2.Ex8.m1]


On the other hand, since the norm of [S2.p39.m2] is not order continuous, it follows
from Theorem 4.51 of [2] that [S2.p39.m3] is lattice embeddable
in [S2.p39.m4], i.e., there exists a lattice homomorphism [S2.p39.m5] and there exist tow positive constants [S2.p39.m6] and [S2.p39.m7] satisfying



[S2.Ex9.m1]


for all [S2.p39.m8]. Put [S2.p39.m9], and note that [S2.p39.m10] is a positive weak almost limited operator (see
Remark 2.3). However, for the disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.p39.m11], we have



[S2.Ex10.m1]


for every [S2.p39.m12]. This show that [S2.p39.m13] is not almost Dunford-Pettis, and we are
done.


[S2.p40.m1] In this case, every operator [S2.p40.m2] is almost Dunford-Pettis.


[S2.p41.m1] Let [S2.p41.m2] be an
order bounded weak almost limited operator and let [S2.p41.m3] be a positive disjoint weakly null sequence. We shall show that [S2.p41.m4]. By corollary 2.6 of [7],
it suffices to proof that [S2.p41.m5] and [S2.p41.m6] for every
disjoint and norm bounded sequence [S2.p41.m7].


Indeed


- Let [S2.p43.m1]. By Theorem 1.23 of [2],
for each [S2.p43.m2] there exists some [S2.p43.m3] with [S2.p43.m4]. Note that the
adjoint operator [S2.p43.m5] is order bounded
[2, Theorem 1.73], and pick some [S2.p43.m6]
with [S2.p43.m7]. So [S2.p43.m8] for all [S2.p43.m9]. Since [S2.p43.m10], then [S2.p43.m11] and
hence [S2.p43.m12]. Thus [S2.p43.m13].


- Let [S2.p44.m1] be a
disjoint and norm bounded sequence. As the norm of [S2.p44.m2] is order continuous,
then by corollary 2.4.3 of [11] [S2.p44.m3]. Now, since [S2.p44.m4] is an order bounded weak almost limited then [S2.p44.m5] (Theorem 2.4). This
complete the proof.
∎



As consequence of Theorem 2.11, we obtain the following
corollary.


Corollary 2.12.

A [S2.Thmtheorem12.p1.m1]-Dedekind complete Banach lattices [S2.Thmtheorem12.p1.m2] has an order continuous
norm if and only if every order bounded weak almost limited operator [S2.Thmtheorem12.p1.m3] is almost Dunford-Pettis.



By Remark 2.3 every operator [S2.p46.m1] is weak
almost limited. As another consequence of Theorem 2.11, we obtain
the following characterization of the positive Schur property.


Corollary 2.13.

A Banach lattices [S2.Thmtheorem13.p1.m1] has the positive Schur property if and only if every
positive operator [S2.Thmtheorem13.p1.m2] is almost Dunford-Pettis.

Abstract.
We introduce and study the class of almost limited sets in Banach lattices, that is, sets on which every disjoint weak[m1] null sequence of functionals converges uniformly to zero. It is established that a Banach lattice has order continuous norm if and only if almost limited sets and [m2]-weakly compact sets coincide. In particular, in terms of almost Dunford-Pettis operators into [m3], we give an operator characterization of those [m4]- Dedekind complete Banach lattices whose relatively weakly compact sets are almost limited, that is, for a [m5]-Dedekind Banach lattice [m6], every relatively weakly compact set in [m7] is almost limited if and only if every continuous linear operator [m8] is an almost Dunford-Pettis operator.

1. Introduction

Throughout this paper [S1.p1.m1] will denote real Banach spaces, and [S1.p1.m2] will denote real Banach lattices. [S1.p1.m3] the closed unit ball of [S1.p1.m4]. [S1.p1.m5] denotes the solid hull of a subset [S1.p1.m6] of a Banach lattice. The positive cone of [S1.p1.m7] will be denoted by [S1.p1.m8].


Let us recall that a bounded subset [S1.p2.m1] of [S1.p2.m2] is called a Dunford-Pettis set (resp. a limited set) in [S1.p2.m3] if each weakly null sequence in [S1.p2.m4] (resp. weak[S1.p2.m5] null sequence in [S1.p2.m6]) converges uniformly to zero on [S1.p2.m7]. Clearly, every limited set in [S1.p2.m8] is a Dunford-Pettis set, but the converse is not true in general. We say that [S1.p2.m9] has the Dunford-Pettis property whenever [S1.p2.m10] in [S1.p2.m11] and [S1.p2.m12] in [S1.p2.m13] imply [S1.p2.m14], equivalently, every relatively weakly compact set in [S1.p2.m15] is a Dunford-Pettis set, alternatively, every weakly compact operator [S1.p2.m16] is a Dunford-Pettis operator. If all limited sets in [S1.p2.m17] are relatively compact, then [S1.p2.m18] is said to be a Gelfand-Phillips space. It is well-known that all separable Banach spaces and all weakly compactly generated spaces are Gelfand-Phillips spaces. Note that a [S1.p2.m19]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice [S1.p2.m20] is a Gelfand-Phillips space if and only if the norm of [S1.p2.m21] is order continuous (cf. [7]). [S1.p2.m22] has the Dunford-Pettis[S1.p2.m23] property (the DP[S1.p2.m24] property for short ) whenever every relatively weakly compact set in [S1.p2.m25] is limited, in other words, for any weakly null sequence [S1.p2.m26] in [S1.p2.m27] and any weak[S1.p2.m28] null sequence [S1.p2.m29] in [S1.p2.m30], [S1.p2.m31]. The DP[S1.p2.m32] property, introduced first by Borwein, Fabian and Vanderwerff [4], is stronger than the Dunford-Pettis property. Carrión, Galindo and Lourenço [9] showed that [S1.p2.m33] has the DP[S1.p2.m34] property if, and only if, every continuous linear operator [S1.p2.m35] is a Dunford-Pettis operator.


Recall that a Banach lattice [S1.p3.m1] has the positive Schur property (i.e., weak Schur property) if every weakly null sequence with positive terms is norm null, equivalently, every disjoint weakly null sequence in [S1.p3.m2] is norm null. A continuous operator [S1.p3.m3] from [S1.p3.m4] into a Banach space is called almost Dunford-Pettis ([13]) if [S1.p3.m5] for every disjoint, weakly null sequence [S1.p3.m6] in [S1.p3.m7]. We say that [S1.p3.m8] has the weak Dunford-Pettis property (wDP property for short) if every weakly compact operator from [S1.p3.m9] into any Banach space [S1.p3.m10] is almost Dunford-Pettis (cf. [11]). It is obvious that the Dunford-Pettis property or the positive Schur property imply the weak Dunford-Pettis property. As Wnuk pointed out in [17], [S1.p3.m11] has the weak Dunford-Pettis property if and only if every weakly compact operator from [S1.p3.m12] into [S1.p3.m13] is almost Dunford-Pettis, equivalently, for every disjoint weakly null sequence [S1.p3.m14] in [S1.p3.m15] and every weakly null sequence [S1.p3.m16] in [S1.p3.m17], [S1.p3.m18].


Recently, Bouras [5] considered the disjoint version of Dunford-Pettis sets and introduced the class of almost Dunford-Pettis sets in Banach lattices. Following Bouras, a bounded subset [S1.p4.m1] of a Banach lattice [S1.p4.m2] is said to be an almost Dunford-Pettis set if every disjoint weakly null sequence [S1.p4.m3] of [S1.p4.m4] converges uniformly to zero on [S1.p4.m5]. He showed that a Banach lattice [S1.p4.m6] has the weak Dunford-Pettis property if and only if every relatively weakly compact set in [S1.p4.m7] is almost Dunford-Pettis ([5]).


Inspired by Carrión, Galindo and Lourenço [9], we may ask under what conditions every continuous operator from a Banach lattice [S1.p5.m1] into [S1.p5.m2] is almost Dunford-Pettis. In this paper, using disjoint sequence techniques we consider the disjoint version of limited sets, i.e., the almost limited sets in Banach lattices ( Definition 2.3). We introduce the weak Dunford-Pettis[S1.p5.m3] property (wDP[S1.p5.m4] property for short) which is shared by those Banach lattices whose relatively weakly compact subsets are almost limited. In terms of almost Dunford-Pettis operators into [S1.p5.m5], we also give an operator characterization of Banach lattices with the wDP[S1.p5.m6] property, that is, a [S1.p5.m7]-Dedekind Banach lattice [S1.p5.m8] has the wDP[S1.p5.m9] property if and only if every continuous operator [S1.p5.m10] is an almost Dunford-Pettis operator. (Theorem 3.5).


Our notions are standard. The reader should see [15, 16, 17] for the (positive) Schur property and the (weak) Dunford-Pettis property of Banach lattices. For the theory of Banach lattices and operators, we refer the reader to the monographs [2, 12].



2. Almost Limited Sets in Banach Lattices

It should be noted that in a Banach lattice (or in its dual) the lattice operations fail to be weakly ( resp. weak[S2.p1.m1]) sequentially continuous in general. Let us recall that every disjoint sequence in the solid hull of a relatively weakly compact subset of a Banach lattice [S2.p1.m2] converges weakly to zero ([2, Theorem 13.3]). Therefore, if [S2.p1.m3] is a disjoint, weakly convergent sequence in [S2.p1.m4], then naturally the sequences [S2.p1.m5], [S2.p1.m6], [S2.p1.m7], [S2.p1.m8] all converge weakly to zero. However, as we shall see from the following example, [S2.p1.m9]-convergent disjoint sequences in the dual can not be that congenial.


Example 2.1.


(1)

Let [S2.I1.i1.p1.m1] be a sequence of evaluation functionals on [S2.I1.i1.p1.m2]. Clearly, [S2.I1.i1.p1.m3] is a disjoint sequence and [S2.I1.i1.p1.m4] in [S2.I1.i1.p1.m5].

(2)

Let [S2.I1.i2.p1.m1] [S2.I1.i2.p1.m2] be defined as follows:
[S2.I1.i2.p1.m3], [S2.I1.i2.p1.m4], [S2.I1.i2.p1.m5]
Then [S2.I1.i2.p1.m6] is a disjoint, weak[S2.I1.i2.p1.m7] null sequence in [S2.I1.i2.p1.m8], but [S2.I1.i2.p1.m9] does not weak[S2.I1.i2.p1.m10] converge to zero. Indeed, [S2.I1.i2.p1.m11], where [S2.I1.i2.p1.m12].





For a [S2.p2.m1]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice, the situation is quite different. More precisely, we have the following lemma.


Lemma 2.2.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m1] be a [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m2]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice, and let [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m3] be a [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m4]-convergent sequence of [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m5]. If [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m6] is a disjoint sequence of [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m7] satisfying [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m8] for each [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m9], then the sequences [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m10], [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m11], [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m12], [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m13] all weak[S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m14] converge to zero. In particular, if [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m15] is a disjoint [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m16]-convergent sequence in its own right, then the sequences [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m17], [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m18], [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m19], [S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m20] are all weak[S2.Thmtheorem2.p1.m21] null.



Proof.

Let [S2.p3.m1], and let [S2.p3.m2]. Since [S2.p3.m3] is [S2.p3.m4]-Dedekind complete and [S2.p3.m5] is a [S2.p3.m6]-convergent sequence of [S2.p3.m7], there exists [S2.p3.m8] lying in the ideal generated by [S2.p3.m9] in [S2.p3.m10] such that



[S2.Ex1.m1]


holds for all [S2.p3.m11] ( [8]; cf. [2, Theorem 13.11]). Therefore, we have



[S2.Ex2.m1]
[S2.Ex2.m2]
[S2.Ex2.m3]




[S2.Ex3.m2]
[S2.Ex3.m3]




[S2.Ex4.m2]
[S2.Ex4.m3]


Because [S2.p3.m12] is an order bounded disjoint sequence, we have [S2.p3.m13], and hence [S2.p3.m14]. This implies [S2.p3.m15] and [S2.p3.m16]. Finally, the inequalities [S2.p3.m17] and [S2.p3.m18] finish the proof.
∎



Next we give the definition of an almost limited set in a Banach lattice, which is the disjoint version of the limited set, and is in a sense also the [S2.p4.m1] - counterpart of the almost Dunford-Pettis set.


Definition 2.3.

A norm bounded subset [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m1] of [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m2] is said to be an almost limited set if every disjoint, weak[S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m3] null sequence [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m4] of [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m5] converges uniformly to zero on [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m6], that is, [S2.Thmtheorem3.p1.m7].



Now we are in a position to give some examples of almost limited sets and distinguish the class of almost limited sets from the classes of relatively (weakly) compact sets, limited sets and (almost) Dunford-Pettis sets, etc.



Remark 2.4.

(1) By the definition of an almost limited set, every order interval in a Banach lattice is almost limited if, and only if, [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m1] for each disjoint [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m2]-null sequence in [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m3] ( [2, Theorem 11.11]). Then, by Lemma 2.2, in a [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m4]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice every order interval is an almost limited set. If [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m5] is not [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m6]-Dedekind complete, an order interval of [S2.Thmtheorem4.p1.m7] is not necessarily almost limited. We can see this from Example 2.1(2).


(2) It is obvious that all relatively compact sets and all limited sets in a Banach lattice are almost limited. The converse does not hold in general. For example, by [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m1] [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m2] is almost limited, but [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m3] is not either compact or limited. We can also find a counterexample in a Banach lattice with order continuous norm. For instance, [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m4] is a Gelfand-Phillips space, but there exists an order interval in [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m5] which is not compact, since [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m6] is not a discrete space (cf. [1, Corollary 21.13]). On the other hand, since [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m7] has order continuous norm (and hence Dedekind complete), by [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m8] each order interval of [S2.Thmtheorem4.p2.m9] is almost limited.


(3) Clearly, every almost limited set is an almost Dunford-Pettis set, but the converse is not true in general. For instance, [S2.Thmtheorem4.p3.m1] is a Dunford-Pettis set (and hence an almost Dunford-Pettis set), but [S2.Thmtheorem4.p3.m2] is not almost limited. It should be noted that in a Grothendieck Banach lattice the class of almost limited sets and the class of almost Dunford-Pettis sets are the same.


(4) A relatively weakly compact set need not be almost limited, and vice versa. For instance, [S2.Thmtheorem4.p4.m1] is weakly compact, but not almost limited. On the other hand, [S2.Thmtheorem4.p4.m2] is not weakly compact, but by [S2.Thmtheorem4.p4.m3] [S2.Thmtheorem4.p4.m4] is almost limited.


(5) It is well known that every limited set is conditionally weakly compact [6], and the Josefson-Nissenzweig theorem precludes any possibility of the closed unit ball of an infinite dimensional Banach space being limited. However, [S2.Thmtheorem4.p5.m1] is indeed almost limited, and by Rosenthal’s [S2.Thmtheorem4.p5.m2] theorem [S2.Thmtheorem4.p5.m3] is not conditionally weakly compact.



Let [S2.p6.m1] be a Banach sublattice of a Banach lattice [S2.p6.m2]. It may happen that a subset [S2.p6.m3] of [S2.p6.m4] is almost limited in [S2.p6.m5], but fails to be almost limited in [S2.p6.m6]. For example, Phillips’ lemma shows that [S2.p6.m7] is a limited set in [S2.p6.m8], but [S2.p6.m9] is not almost limited in [S2.p6.m10]. It should also be noted that the solid hull of an almost limited set in a Banach lattice is not necessarily almost limited. For instance, the singleton [S2.p6.m11] is certainly almost limited in [S2.p6.m12], but [S2.p6.m13][S2.p6.m14][S2.p6.m15] is not almost limited (see Example 2.1 (2)). A further investigation will be made in Remark 2.7 (2). The following theorem characterizes solid sets being almost limited.


Theorem 2.5.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem5.p1.m1] be a norm bounded solid subset of a [S2.Thmtheorem5.p1.m2]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice [S2.Thmtheorem5.p1.m3]. Then the following statements are equivalent.



(1)

[S2.I2.i1.p1.m1] is an almost limited set in [S2.I2.i1.p1.m2].

(2)

For each disjoint sequence [S2.I2.i2.p1.m1] in [S2.I2.i2.p1.m2] and each disjoint [S2.I2.i2.p1.m3]-null sequence [S2.I2.i2.p1.m4] in [S2.I2.i2.p1.m5], we have [S2.I2.i2.p1.m6].

(3)

For each disjoint sequence [S2.I2.i3.p1.m1] in [S2.I2.i3.p1.m2] and each disjoint [S2.I2.i3.p1.m3]-null sequence [S2.I2.i3.p1.m4] in [S2.I2.i3.p1.m5], we have [S2.I2.i3.p1.m6].





Proof.

[S2.p7.m1] Obvious.


[S2.p8.m1] Let [S2.p8.m2] be an arbitrary disjoint [S2.p8.m3]-null sequence in [S2.p8.m4]. To finish the proof, we have to show that [S2.p8.m5]. Assume by way of contradiction that [S2.p8.m6] does not converge to 0 as [S2.p8.m7]. Then, by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can suppose that there would exist some [S2.p8.m8] such that [S2.p8.m9] for all [S2.p8.m10]. Note that the equality [S2.p8.m11] holds, since [S2.p8.m12] is solid. Therefore, for each [S2.p8.m13] choose some [S2.p8.m14] satisfying [S2.p8.m15]. In view of Lemma 2.2, we have [S2.p8.m16]. Let [S2.p8.m17]. Because [S2.p8.m18] [S2.p8.m19], there exists some [S2.p8.m20] such that [S2.p8.m21]. Again, since [S2.p8.m22] [S2.p8.m23], choose some [S2.p8.m24] [S2.p8.m25] satisfying [S2.p8.m26]. It is easy to see that, by induction, we can find a strictly increasing subsequence [S2.p8.m27] of [S2.p8.m28] such that [S2.p8.m29] for all [S2.p8.m30]. Let



[S2.Ex5.m1]


Then, in view of [2, Lemma 13.4] [S2.p8.m31] is a disjoint sequence, and [S2.p8.m32] because [S2.p8.m33] and [S2.p8.m34] is solid. Now, we have



[S2.Ex6.m1]
[S2.Ex6.m2]
[S2.Ex6.m3]




[S2.Ex7.m2]
[S2.Ex7.m3]




[S2.Ex8.m2]
[S2.Ex8.m3]




[S2.Ex9.m2]
[S2.Ex9.m3]


Note that [S2.p8.m35] [S2.p8.m36]. Hence, [S2.p8.m37]. On the other hand, since [S2.p8.m38] is a disjoint sequence of [S2.p8.m39] and [S2.p8.m40] is a disjoint [S2.p8.m41]-null sequence in [S2.p8.m42], by hypothesis we have [S2.p8.m43]. This leads to a contradiction, and the proof is completed.
∎



Let us recall that a norm bounded subset [S2.p9.m1] of a Banach lattice [S2.p9.m2] is called to be [S2.p9.m3]-weakly compact if [S2.p9.m4] for every disjoint sequence [S2.p9.m5] contained in the solid hull of [S2.p9.m6] (cf. [12, Definition 3.6.1]). Every [S2.p9.m7]-weakly compact set is relatively weakly compact set, but the converse does not hold in general. In an [S2.p9.m8]-space, [S2.p9.m9]-weakly compact sets and relatively weakly compact sets coincide. More generally, every relatively weakly compact subset of [S2.p9.m10] is [S2.p9.m11]-weakly compact if, and only if, [S2.p9.m12] has the positive Schur property ([12, Corollary 3.6.8]). As we see from Remark 2.4 (4), an almost limited set need not be relatively weakly compact (hence not [S2.p9.m13]-weakly compact) even if the Banach lattice is Dedekind complete. The following theorem deals with the relationship of [S2.p9.m14]-weakly compact sets with almost limited sets.


Theorem 2.6.

(1) Every [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m1]-weakly compact set in a Banach lattice [S2.Thmtheorem6.p1.m2] is an almost limited set.


(2) The norm of [S2.Thmtheorem6.p2.m1] is order continuous if, and only if, each almost limited set in [S2.Thmtheorem6.p2.m2] is [S2.Thmtheorem6.p2.m3]-weakly compact.



Proof.

(1) Let [S2.p10.m1] be an [S2.p10.m2]-weakly compact subset of [S2.p10.m3], and let [S2.p10.m4] be any disjoint [S2.p10.m5]-null sequence of [S2.p10.m6]. By Proposition 3.6.2 of [12] we have [S2.p10.m7]. The inequality [S2.p10.m8] implies that [S2.p10.m9] converges uniformly to zero on [S2.p10.m10], that is, [S2.p10.m11] is an almost limited set.


(2) Assume that [S2.p11.m1] has order continuous norm. Let [S2.p11.m2] be an almost limited set in [S2.p11.m3]. To prove that [S2.p11.m4] is [S2.p11.m5]-weakly compact, by Proposition 3.6.2 of [12] we only need to show that [S2.p11.m6] for every norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p11.m7] of [S2.p11.m8], where [S2.p11.m9] is defined by



[S2.Ex10.m1]


for every [S2.p11.m10]. Assume by way of contradiction that [S2.p11.m11] does not tend to 0 as [S2.p11.m12] for some norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p11.m13] of [S2.p11.m14]. Then, by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can suppose that there would exist some [S2.p11.m15] satisfying [S2.p11.m16] for all [S2.p11.m17]. For each [S2.p11.m18] choose some [S2.p11.m19] and some [S2.p11.m20] with [S2.p11.m21] such that [S2.p11.m22]. Clearly, [S2.p11.m23] is likewise a norm bounded disjoint sequence. It follows from the order continuity of the norm of [S2.p11.m24] that [S2.p11.m25] ([12, Corollary 2.4.3]). Since [S2.p11.m26] is almost limited, [S2.p11.m27] converges uniformly to 0 on [S2.p11.m28], which implies that [S2.p11.m29]. This leads to a contradiction.


Now assume that every almost limited set in [S2.p12.m1] is [S2.p12.m2]-weakly compact. To establish that the norm of [S2.p12.m3] is order continuous, it suffices to show that every disjoint sequence [S2.p12.m4] from [S2.p12.m5] is [S2.p12.m6]-null ([12, Corollary 2.4.3]). To this end, let [S2.p12.m7]. Clearly, the singleton [S2.p12.m8] is almost limited, and hence by hypothesis [S2.p12.m9] is [S2.p12.m10]-weakly compact. By Proposition 3.6.2 of [12], we have [S2.p12.m11]. The inequality [S2.p12.m12] finishes the proof.
∎



Remark 2.7.

(1) It should be noted that, in a [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m1]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m2], every limited set is relatively compact (i.e., [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m3] is a Gelfand-Phillips space) if, and only if, the norm of [S2.Thmtheorem7.p1.m4] is order continuous (cf. [7]).


(2) From the remarks just preceding Theorem 2.5 we see that the solid hull of an almost limited set is not necessarily almost limited. If [S2.Thmtheorem7.p2.m1] has order continuous norm, then by Theorem 2.6 (2) the solid hull of an almost limited set in [S2.Thmtheorem7.p2.m2] is almost limited, since the solid hull of an [S2.Thmtheorem7.p2.m3]-weakly set is likewise [S2.Thmtheorem7.p2.m4]-weakly compact. However, the converse does not hold in general. For instance, every norm bounded set in [S2.Thmtheorem7.p2.m5] is almost limited, but the norm of [S2.Thmtheorem7.p2.m6] is not order continuous.




Let us recall that a norm bounded subset [S2.p13.m1] of [S2.p13.m2] is called an [S2.p13.m3] -set whenever every weakly null sequence [S2.p13.m4] of [S2.p13.m5] converges uniformly to zero on the set [S2.p13.m6], that is, [S2.p13.m7] (cf. [10]). Recently, Aqzzouz and Bouras [3] introduced the class of almost [S2.p13.m8] -sets in Banach lattices. A norm bounded subset [S2.p13.m9] of the dual [S2.p13.m10] of a Banach lattice [S2.p13.m11] is said to be an almost [S2.p13.m12] -set if every disjoint, weakly null sequence [S2.p13.m13] of [S2.p13.m14] converges uniformly to zero on [S2.p13.m15]. In [S2.p13.m16] the following implications are clear:



[S2.Ex11.m1]


From Corollary 2.12 of [5] and Theorem 2.6 it follows that if [S2.p13.m17] has order continuous norm, then the class of almost limited sets and the class of almost Dunford-Pettis sets coincide in [S2.p13.m18]. Indeed, we can say more.


Theorem 2.8.

Let [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m1] be a Banach lattice. If the norm of [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m2] is order continuous, then in [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m3] the class of almost limited sets, the class of almost Dunford-Pettis sets and the class of almost [S2.Thmtheorem8.p1.m4] -sets are the same.



The proof of Theorem 2.8 is based on Theorem 2.6 and the following lemma.


Lemma 2.9.

Every almost [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m1] -set in [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m2] is [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m3] -weakly compact if and only if [S2.Thmtheorem9.p1.m4] has order continuous norm.



Proof.

Assume that the norm of [S2.p15.m1] is order continuous. Let [S2.p15.m2] be an almost [S2.p15.m3] -set in [S2.p15.m4]. To establish [S2.p15.m5]-weak compactness of [S2.p15.m6], by Proposition 3.6.3 of [12] we only have to show that for every norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p15.m7] of [S2.p15.m8],



[S2.Ex12.m1]


Assume by way of contradiction that [S2.p15.m9] does not converge to 0 for some norm bounded disjoint sequence [S2.p15.m10] of [S2.p15.m11]. Then, by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can suppose that there exists some [S2.p15.m12] such that



[S2.Ex13.m1]


for all [S2.p15.m13]. For each [S2.p15.m14] choose some [S2.p15.m15] and some [S2.p15.m16] with [S2.p15.m17] satisfying [S2.p15.m18]. We can see that [S2.p15.m19] is a norm bounded disjoint sequence. The order continuity of the norm of [S2.p15.m20] implies that [S2.p15.m21] ([12, Corollary 2.4.14]). Since [S2.p15.m22] is an almost [S2.p15.m23] -set in [S2.p15.m24], the disjoint weakly null sequence [S2.p15.m25] converges uniformly to 0 on [S2.p15.m26], which implies that [S2.p15.m27]. This contradicts with [S2.p15.m28]. Therefore, [S2.p15.m29] is [S2.p15.m30] -weakly compact.


For the converse, assume that each almost [S2.p16.m1] -set in [S2.p16.m2] is [S2.p16.m3] -weakly compact. To prove that [S2.p16.m4] has order continuous norm, we need only to show that every disjoint sequence [S2.p16.m5] of [S2.p16.m6] is weakly null ([12, Corollary 2.4.14]). For this, let [S2.p16.m7]. Clearly, the singleton [S2.p16.m8] is an almost [S2.p16.m9] -set in [S2.p16.m10], and by hypothesis [S2.p16.m11] is [S2.p16.m12]-weakly compact. In view of Proposition 3.6.3 of [12], we have [S2.p16.m13]. Clearly, [S2.p16.m14], as desired.

3. The Weak Dunford-Pettis[S3.m1] Property of Banach Lattices

Recall that a Banach space is said to have the DP[S3.p1.m1] property if all relatively weakly compact sets are limited. Similarly, we introduce the so-called wDP[S3.p1.m2] property of a Banach lattice.


Definition 3.1.

A Banach lattice [S3.Thmtheorem1.p1.m1] is called to have the weak Dunford-Pettis[S3.Thmtheorem1.p1.m2] property (wDP[S3.Thmtheorem1.p1.m3] property for short) if every relatively weakly compact set in [S3.Thmtheorem1.p1.m4] is almost limited.




In other words, [S3.p2.m1] has the wDP[S3.p2.m2] property if and only if for each weakly null sequence [S3.p2.m3] in [S3.p2.m4] and each disjoint [S3.p2.m5]-null sequence in [S3.p2.m6], [S3.p2.m7].


When the Banach lattice is [S3.p3.m1]-Dedekind complete, we can characterize the wDP[S3.p3.m2] property in terms of disjoint sequences.


Theorem 3.2.

For a [S3.Thmtheorem2.p1.m1]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice [S3.Thmtheorem2.p1.m2], the following statements are equivalent:

(1)

[S3.I1.i1.p1.m1] has the wDP[S3.I1.i1.p1.m2] property.

(2)

For each disjoint weakly null sequence [S3.I1.i2.p1.m1] and each disjoint [S3.I1.i2.p1.m2]-null sequence [S3.I1.i2.p1.m3], we have [S3.I1.i2.p1.m4].

(3)

For each disjoint weakly null sequence [S3.I1.i3.p1.m1] and each disjoint [S3.I1.i3.p1.m2]-null sequence [S3.I1.i3.p1.m3], we have [S3.I1.i3.p1.m4].

(4)

The solid hull of every relatively weakly compact set in [S3.I1.i4.p1.m1] is almost limited.





Proof.

Only [S3.p4.m1] needs a proof. To this end, let [S3.p4.m2] be a relatively weakly compact set in [S3.p4.m3]. It should be noted that each disjoint sequence in the solid hull [S3.p4.m4] of [S3.p4.m5] converges weakly to 0 (see [2, Theorem 13.3]). So, for every disjoint sequence [S3.p4.m6] in [S3.p4.m7] and every disjoint [S3.p4.m8]-null sequence [S3.p4.m9] of [S3.p4.m10], by hypothesis we have [S3.p4.m11]. Hence, it follows from Theorem 2.5 that [S3.p4.m12] is almost limited.
∎



Since every Banach lattice with order continuous norm is a Gelfand-Phillips space, [S3.p5.m1] has the Schur property if and only if [S3.p5.m2] has both order continuous norm and the DP[S3.p5.m3] property. Let us recall that a Banach lattice [S3.p5.m4] has the positive Schur property if and only if every relatively weakly compact subset of [S3.p5.m5] is [S3.p5.m6]-weakly compact ([12, Corollary 3.6.8]). Every Banach lattice with the positive Schur property is a KB-space (and hence has order continuous norm). Therefore, by Theorem 2.6 we have the following easy result and omit the proof.


Proposition 3.3.

A Banach lattice [S3.Thmtheorem3.p1.m1] has the positive Schur property if, and only if, [S3.Thmtheorem3.p1.m2] has order continuous norm and the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem3.p1.m3] property.



Remark 3.4.

(1) It is obvious that the (positive) Schur property and the DP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m1] property imply the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m2] property. However, [S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m3] is a Dedekind complete Banach lattice with the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m4] property which has neither the (positive) Schur property nor the DP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m5] property since [S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m6] has the DP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m7] property without the positive Schur property, whereas [S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m8] has the positive Schur property without the DP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m9] property (a separable Banach space with the DP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p1.m10] property must have the Schur property).


(2) Clearly, every Banach lattice with the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p2.m1] property has the wDP property, but the converse is not necessarily true. For instance, [S3.Thmtheorem4.p2.m2] enjoys the Dunford-Pettis property (hence the wDP property), but by Proposition 3.3 [S3.Thmtheorem4.p2.m3] does not have the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p2.m4] property.



(3) It is known that if the norm dual [S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m1] of a Banach lattice [S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m2] has the (weak) Dunford-Pettis property, so does [S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m3] (cf. [2, Theorem 19.5] and [17, Proposition 2]). This does not necessarily hold for the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m4] property. For example, [S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m5] has the Schur property, but [S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m6] does not have the wDP[S3.Thmtheorem4.p3.m7] property.



In [9] it was proved that a Banach space [S3.p6.m1] has the DP[S3.p6.m2] property if and only if every operator from [S3.p6.m3] into [S3.p6.m4] is a Dunford-Pettis operator. On the other hand, Wnuk [17] characterized the positive Schur property of a Banach lattice: a Banach lattice [S3.p6.m5] has the positive Schur property if, and only if, [S3.p6.m6] has order continuous norm and each continuous operator [S3.p6.m7] is almost Dunford-Pettis. Comparing this with Proposition 3.3 in the present paper we naturally posed the following theorem.


Theorem 3.5.

For a [S3.Thmtheorem5.p1.m1]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice [S3.Thmtheorem5.p1.m2], the following statements are equivalent.



(1)

[S3.I2.i1.p1.m1] has the wDP[S3.I2.i1.p1.m2] property.

(2)

Every continuous operator [S3.I2.i2.p1.m1] is an almost Dunford-Pettis operator.

(3)

Every positive operator [S3.I2.i3.p1.m1] is an almost Dunford-Pettis operator.

(4)

Every positive operator [S3.I2.i4.p1.m1] is a Dunford-Pettis operator.





Proof.

[S3.p7.m1] Obvious.


[S3.p8.m1] This is because a positive operator [S3.p8.m2] from a Banach lattice into a discrete Banach lattice with order continuous norm (e.g., [S3.p8.m3]) is almost Dunford-Pettis if and only if [S3.p8.m4] is Dunford-Pettis. See Example 4 of almost Dunford-Pettis operators on p. 230 of [17].


[S3.p9.m1] To prove that [S3.p9.m2] has the wDP[S3.p9.m3] property, in view of Theorem 3.2 it is enough to show that for each disjoint weakly null sequence [S3.p9.m4] and each disjoint [S3.p9.m5]-null sequence [S3.p9.m6], we have [S3.p9.m7]. To this end, let [S3.p9.m8] be defined by [S3.p9.m9] for any [S3.p9.m10]. Clearly, the thus defined operator [S3.p9.m11] is a positive operator. By hypothesis, [S3.p9.m12] is an almost Dunford-Pettis operator. Therefore, [S3.p9.m13] as [S3.p9.m14], and hence [S3.p9.m15], as desired.


[S3.p10.m1] Let [S3.p10.m2] be an arbitrary continuous linear operator. To finish the proof, we have to show that [S3.p10.m3] for every disjoint weakly null sequence [S3.p10.m4] of [S3.p10.m5]. Assume by way of contradiction that [S3.p10.m6] does not tend to 0 for some disjoint weakly null sequence [S3.p10.m7] of [S3.p10.m8]. Then, by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can suppose that there would exist some [S3.p10.m9] such that [S3.p10.m10] for all [S3.p10.m11]. For every [S3.p10.m12], there exists a canonical projection, say [S3.p10.m13], from [S3.p10.m14] into its coordinate space [S3.p10.m15] such that [S3.p10.m16]. Applying the idea used in the proof of Proposition 2.1 in [9], we can show that the sequence [S3.p10.m17] can not be bounded. Again by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can suppose that [S3.p10.m18] is strictly increasing. Then [S3.p10.m19] is a [S3.p10.m20]-null sequence of [S3.p10.m21]. Note that [S3.p10.m22] is a disjoint weakly null sequence of [S3.p10.m23]. So, in view of [2,  Ex. 22, p.73] there exists a disjoint sequence [S3.p10.m24] in [S3.p10.m25] such that



[S3.Ex1.m1]


Since [S3.p10.m26], by Lemma 2.2 we have [S3.p10.m27] in [S3.p10.m28]. By hypothesis that [S3.p10.m29] has the wDP[S3.p10.m30] property, it follows
from Theorem 3.2 that [S3.p10.m31] as [S3.p10.m32]. On the other hand,



[S3.Ex2.m1]


This leads to a contradiction. Hence, [S3.p10.m33] for every disjoint weakly null sequence [S3.p10.m34] of [S3.p10.m35], that is, [S3.p10.m36] is an almost Dunford-Pettis operator.
∎



Let [S3.p11.m1] denote the Banach space of all continuous linear operators between Banach lattices [S3.p11.m2] and [S3.p11.m3], and let [S3.p11.m4] denote the linear subspace of all regular operators, i.e., operators which can be written as the differences of two positive operators. It may be asked whether [S3.p11.m5] holds in Theorem 3.5. An earlier result due to Wnuk [14] states that, for a [S3.p11.m6]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice [S3.p11.m7], [S3.p11.m8] if and only if [S3.p11.m9] is a discrete Banach lattice with order continuous norm. Therefore, even though [S3.p11.m10] and [S3.p11.m11] are the right spaces for Theorem 3.5, we can see that
[S3.p11.m12],  [S3.p11.m13],   [S3.p11.m14].


It should also be noted that the wDP property is inherited by a closed ideal of a Banach lattice [S3.p12.m1] ([17, Proposition 3]), whereas the wDP[S3.p12.m2] is not. Consider [S3.p12.m3] as a closed ideal of [S3.p12.m4]. However, by Theorem 3.5 it is not surprising that [S3.p12.m5]-Dedekind complete complemented sublattices of a [S3.p12.m6]-Dedekind complete Banach lattice with the wDP[S3.p12.m7] property have this property too.
